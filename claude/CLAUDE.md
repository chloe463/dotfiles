# 🏗️ CLAUDE.md - Claude Code Global Configuration

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working across all projects.

## Conversation guidelines

- You can use both English and Japanese.
- If the project's CLAUDE.md doesn't specify a language, use English.
- If you are uncertain about how to complete the task, stop and ask questions.
- NEVER proceed with the task if you have any problems or doubts.

## 📋 Overview

This is my global Claude Code configuration directory (`~/.claude`) that sets up:
- Professional development standards and workflows
- Language-specific best practices (TypeScript, Bash)
- Permission rules for tool usage
- Environment variables for development
- Session history and todo management

## 🧠 Proactive AI Assistance

### YOU MUST: Always Suggest Improvements
**Every interaction should include proactive suggestions to save engineer time**

1. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Identify repeated code patterns and suggest abstractions
   - Detect potential performance bottlenecks before they matter
   - Recognize missing error handling and suggest additions
   - Spot opportunities for parallelization or caching

2. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Suggest more idiomatic approaches for the language
   - Recommend better library choices based on project needs
   - Propose architectural improvements when patterns emerge
   - Identify technical debt and suggest refactoring plans

3. **Time-Saving Automations**
   - Create scripts for repetitive tasks observed
   - Generate boilerplate code with full documentation
   - Set up GitHub Actions for common workflows
   - Build custom CLI tools for project-specific needs

4. **Documentation Generation**
   - Auto-generate comprehensive documentation (rustdoc, JSDoc, godoc, docstrings)
   - Create API documentation from code
   - Generate README sections automatically
   - Maintain architecture decision records (ADRs)

### Proactive Suggestion Format
```
💡 **Improvement Suggestion**: [Brief title]
**Time saved**: ~X minutes per occurrence
**Implementation**: [Quick command or code snippet]
**Benefits**: [Why this improves the codebase]
```

## 🎯 Development Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Engineer time is precious** - Automate everything possible
- **Quality without bureaucracy** - Smart defaults over process
- **Proactive assistance** - Suggest improvements before asked
- **Self-documenting code** - Generate docs automatically
- **Continuous improvement** - Learn from patterns and optimize

## 📚 AI Assistant Guidelines

### Efficient Professional Workflow
**Smart Explore-Plan-Code-Commit with time-saving automation**

#### 1. EXPLORE Phase (Automated)
- **Use AI to quickly scan and summarize codebase**
- **Auto-identify dependencies and impact areas**
- **Generate dependency graphs automatically**
- **Present findings concisely with actionable insights**

#### 2. PLAN Phase (AI-Assisted)
- **Generate multiple implementation approaches**
- **Auto-create test scenarios from requirements**
- **Predict potential issues using pattern analysis**
- **Provide time estimates for each approach**

#### 3. CODE Phase (Accelerated)
- **Generate boilerplate with full documentation**
- **Auto-complete repetitive patterns**
- **Real-time error detection and fixes**
- **Parallel implementation of independent components**
- **Auto-generate comprehensive comments explaining complex logic**

### Documentation & Code Quality Requirements
- **YOU MUST: Generate comprehensive documentation for every function**
- **YOU MUST: Add clear comments explaining business logic**
- **YOU MUST: Create examples in documentation**
- **YOU MUST: Auto-fix all linting/formatting issues**
- **YOU MUST: Generate unit tests for new code**
- **YOU MUST: Output plan and temporary files to .ai_logs of working repository**

#### Setting up .ai_logs directory
The `.ai_logs` directory is used to store AI-generated plans, analysis, and temporary work files.

```bash
# Create in project root
mkdir -p .ai_logs

# Already ignored by global gitignore
# No additional configuration needed
```

**File naming convention:**
- Use format: `.ai_logs/YYYY/MM/YYYYMMDD_<topic>.md`
- Create year/month subdirectories: `mkdir -p .ai_logs/YYYY/MM`
- Examples:
  - `.ai_logs/2026/02/20260208_refactoring_plan.md`
  - `.ai_logs/2026/01/20260115_api_design.md`
  - `.ai_logs/2025/12/20251230_performance_analysis.md`

**What to store in .ai_logs:**
- Planning documents and design decisions
- Code analysis reports
- Refactoring plans
- TODO lists and task breakdowns
- Experiment results and benchmarks

## 📘 TypeScript Development

### Core Rules
- **Package Manager**: Use `yarn` > `npm` > `pnpm`
- **Type Safety**: `strict: true` in tsconfig.json
- **Null Handling**: Use optional chaining `?.` and nullish coalescing `??`
- **Imports**: Use ES modules, avoid require()

### Code Quality Tools

Commands differ between projects, so please check the project's package.json before running the formatting command.

```bash
# Format code
yarn format

# Lint code
yarn lint

# Type check
yarn typecheck

# Run tests
yarn test
```

### Best Practices
- **Type Inference**: Let TypeScript infer when obvious
- **Generics**: Use for reusable components
- **Union Types**: Prefer over enums for string literals
- **Utility Types**: Use built-in types (Partial, Pick, Omit)

## 🐚 Bash Development

### Core Rules
- **Shebang**: Always `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- **Set Options**: Use `set -euo pipefail`
- **Quoting**: Always quote variables `"${var}"`
- **Functions**: Use local variables

### Best Practices
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# Global variables in UPPERCASE
readonly SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"
readonly SCRIPT_NAME="$(basename "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")"

# Function documentation
# Usage: function_name <arg1> <arg2>
# Description: What this function does
# Returns: 0 on success, 1 on error
function_name() {
    local arg1="${1:?Error: arg1 required}"
    local arg2="${2:-default}"
    
    # Implementation
}

# Error handling
trap 'echo "Error on line $LINENO"' ERR
```

## 🚫 Security and Quality Standards

### NEVER Rules (Non-negotiable)
- **NEVER: Delete production data without explicit confirmation**
- **NEVER: Hardcode API keys, passwords, or secrets**
- **NEVER: Commit code with failing tests or linting errors**
- **NEVER: Push directly to main/master branch**
- **NEVER: Skip security reviews for authentication/authorization code**
- **NEVER: Use `any` type in TypeScript production code**

### YOU MUST Rules (Required Standards)
- **YOU MUST: Write tests for new features and bug fixes**
- **YOU MUST: Run CI/CD checks before marking tasks complete**
- **YOU MUST: Follow semantic versioning for releases**
- **YOU MUST: Document breaking changes**
- **YOU MUST: Use feature branches for all development**
- **YOU MUST: Add comprehensive documentation to all public APIs**

## 🤖 AI-Powered Code Review

### Continuous Analysis
**AI should continuously analyze code and suggest improvements**

```
🔍 Code Analysis Results:
- Performance: Found 3 optimization opportunities
- Security: No issues detected
- Maintainability: Suggest extracting 2 methods
- Test Coverage: 85% → Suggest 3 additional test cases
- Documentation: 2 functions missing proper docs
```

## 📊 Efficiency Metrics & Tracking

### Time Savings Report
**Request weekly efficiency reports from Claude**

*Note: This is an example of reports you can request from Claude, not an automated feature.*

```
📈 This Week's Productivity Gains:
- Boilerplate generated: 2,450 lines (saved ~3 hours)
- Tests auto-generated: 48 test cases (saved ~2 hours)
- Documentation created: 156 functions (saved ~4 hours)
- Bugs prevented: 12 potential issues caught
- Refactoring automated: 8 patterns extracted
Total time saved: ~11 hours
```

**How to request:**
- Ask Claude: "Can you provide a weekly efficiency report?"
- Claude will analyze the session history and generate insights

## 🔧 Commit Standards

### Conventional Commits
```bash
# Format: <type>(<scope>): <subject>
git commit -m "feat(auth): add JWT token refresh"
git commit -m "fix(api): handle null response correctly"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation steps"
git commit -m "perf(db): optimize query performance"
git commit -m "refactor(core): extract validation logic"
```

### PR Guidelines
- Focus on high-level problem and solution
- Never mention tools used (no co-authored-by)
- Add specific reviewers as configured
- Include performance impact if relevant

Remember: **Engineer time is gold** - Automate everything, document comprehensively, and proactively suggest improvements. Every interaction should save time and improve code quality.
